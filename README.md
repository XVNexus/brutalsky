# Brutalsky

A physics-based PVP game featuring balls and fully interactive levels


## Features

### Chaotic Combat
Take control of a powerful radioactive sphere. Use the arrow keys to roll and jump. Press and hold the spacebar to build up energy, and release to multiply your speed and fly through the air. Ram into your opponents to damage and weaken their containment shield. Don't let your containment shield get too thin!

### Magnificent Maps
Maps are the main element of Brutalsky. Each map is a unique play area with it's own layout, obstacles, and special interactions. Add walls, movable boxes, and pools of lava. Use joints to create balance beams, elevators, or deadly gears. Use the map editor* to create the world of your dreams!

### Superpowered Simulation
Brutalsky uses the full power of Unity's 2D physics engine. Build intriciate mazes with traps and obstacles, duel in zero-gravity arenas with killer sawblades, drive war mechs in an apocalyptic city, your imagination is the limit!

### Mathematical Madness
Add triggers to detect players going where they shouldn't go. Build a controllable claw machine using mounts. Use the logic system to make fun special effects, proximity activated traps, or even fully controllable vehicles!

### Limitless Levels
Why limit yourself to one screen? If your map is too large, the camera will zoom in and follow the players. Create a map as large as you like, and Brutalsky will handle the rest!
